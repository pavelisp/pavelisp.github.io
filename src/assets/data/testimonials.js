      testimonial: 
`Pavel is one of the most exceptional developers I have ever worked with. More importantly though, he is also one of the most approachable and unintimidating. Languages, frameworks, concepts, etc... with which he is unfamiliar don't tend to stay unfamiliar for long. His curiosity is endless and his approach to self-guided learning is amazingly comprehensive; Pavel's understanding of any facet of development is never only surface-level.

I could go on about the ways in which Pavel is an incredibly gifted programmer, but I will sum it up by saying that he is one of the rare developers whose code I would not mind inheriting on a project.
      
But more important than any of that is his gift for collaboration and leadership. He was asked to help teach a bootcamp based largely on what a natural mentor he was to his peers. Students knew that no matter what the question was, Pavel would have the answer or be able to guide them in the right way to look for it, and in a way that they would be able to understand. Many students told me that after I had delivered a lecture, discussing the content with Pavel afterwords was what really helped the concepts click into place. He has a gift for articulating complex concepts in a very clear and concise way.
      
I genuinely envy anyone who has the opportunity to work with Pavel; every day that I had the privilege to do so, I looked forward to seeing him.`,

      testimonial: 
`Pavel exceeded expectations in his capacity as a TA at BrainStation. With the help of Pavel's mentorship and technical assistance, we graduated one of the strongest Web Dev cohorts that I've seen. He brought the perfect balance of professionalism and levity to the role, which allowed him to connect with the students he was supporting on a daily basis. His technical expertise post-bootcamp was very impressive, but, more importantly, he was continuously learning and filling in gaps so that he could better respond to the needs of those who depended on him. I am especially appreciative of Pavel's capacity to bring energy and life into any meeting or task. It's clear that he's passionate about full-stack development and will no doubt excel in this field very quickly.`,
